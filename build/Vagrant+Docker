  # Run the docker provider using:
  #
  # % vagrant up --provider=docker
  #
  # On systems that can't run Linux containers natively, such as Mac
  # OS X or Windows, Vagrant automatically spins up a "host VM" to run
  # Docker. This allows your Docker-based Vagrant environments to
  # remain portable, without inconsistencies depending on the platform
  # they are running on.
  #
  # Vagrant will spin up a single instance of a host VM and run
  # multiple containers on this one VM. This means that with the
  # Docker provider, you only have the overhead of one virtual
  # machine, and only if it is absolutely necessary.
  #
  # By default, the host VM Vagrant spins up is backed by boot2docker,
  # because it launches quickly and uses minimal resources. We disable
  # this default by specifying our own Vagrantfile for the host VM. See
  # the notes below for "d.vagrant_vagrantfile.

    # Vagrant can also build and run images based on a local
    # Dockerfile. This is useful for iterating on an application
    # locally that is built into an image later.
    #
    # When vagrant up --provider=docker is run, Vagrant automatically
    # builds that Dockerfile and starts a container based on it.
