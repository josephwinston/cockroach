# Build a statically linked Cockroach binary
#
# Requires a working cockroach/cockroach-dev image from which the cockroach
# binary and some other necessary resources are taken. Additionally, we built
# test binaries which are mounted into the appropriate location on the deploy
# image, running them once. These are not a part of the resulting image but
# make sure that at least on the machine that creates the deploy image, the
# tests all pass.
